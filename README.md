###Long Term Ecological Monitoring Application

LTEMA streamlines the process of collecting ground cover observations for BC Parks and the LTEM environmental monitoring protocols. Developed using Titanium and targeting the iPad, the application replaces the current pen-and-paper method of recording observations.

## Features

Implementation of the LTEMA is projected to increase the efficiency of field data collection by reducing the transcription errors caused by the current pen and paper data collection method.  The application will validate input data on-site and prevent the submission of incomplete data.  

Data collection efficiency will increase with the use of the deviceâ€™s built-in hardware, such as the GPS and camera, thus eliminating the current need for these external devices.  The overall goal of the LTEMA is to streamline the current data collection protocol and result in more efficient and valid data collection. 

* validates input on-site and in real-time
* searches multiple taxonomy levels simultaneously
* integrates GPS and camera into the site survey process
* exports data and linked photos in one bundle
* pre-populates a revisted site with static measurements

## Usage

## Requirements

## Installation
Installed onto Apple iPads, via one of two distribution methods:
1. itms:// protocol, a.k.a. "over the air" deployment
2. enterprise archive/build, via 'distribute using enterprise deployment' option

## Project Status
This app is stable at Release 1.0.0.   Thanks to the original Capstone team of:
* Nick Gulajec
* Blair White
* Rory Drysdale

## Goals/Roadmap

The aim of the LTEMA project is to ensure that the field measurements required by the LTEM Protocols are recorded accurately, completely, and as automatically as possible.  The ultimate purpose of the project is to enhance the data collection and validation processes of LTEM by minimizing the need to re-enter data and by performing some of the validation on site.

### Benefits and Rationale
A major benefit identified by LTEMA is the reduction of errors in the field officer observation process.  All measurements will be recorded digitally to avoid transcription errors. The parameters of time, date, and location will be recorded automatically to streamline data collection and assist in improving data quality.  

Incomplete site survey observations are a source of strain on staffing, scheduling, and budget.  LTEMA aims to eliminate the possibility of an incomplete survey by prompting the user for all required reporting data.
